            <h2>What Are K-POP Group Positions?</h2>
            <p>In the world of K-POP, group positions are not random assignments &mdash; they are carefully designated roles based on each member's <strong>skills, personality, and stage presence</strong>. These positions originated in the early days of Korean idol culture and have since become a defining feature of K-POP groups worldwide.</p>
            <p>Unlike Western boy bands or girl groups, where roles are often informal, K-POP positions are officially announced by entertainment companies and are an essential part of each idol's identity. Fans closely follow and discuss these positions, making them a core element of K-POP fan culture.</p>

            <div class="info-card">
                <h4>Quick Position Overview</h4>

                <h3>What is the difference between Main and Lead positions in K-POP?</h3>
                <p>In K-POP, "Main" positions indicate the most skilled member in that area (e.g., Main Vocalist = best singer), while "Lead" positions are the second-most skilled.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can a K-POP idol have multiple positions?</h3>
                <p>Yes, many K-POP idols hold multiple positions simultaneously. For example, a member might be both the Main Dancer and Lead Rapper, or the Visual and Sub-Vocalist. In smaller groups especially, members often fill two or three roles. Some versatile idols are known as "all-rounders" because they excel in singing, dancing, and rapping.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What does the Visual position mean in K-POP?</h3>
                <p>The Visual is the member officially recognized as the face of the group based on Korean beauty standards. They often get the most screen time in music videos, lead photo shoots, and represent the group in variety shows and advertisements. Being the Visual does not mean other members are less attractive &mdash; it is a designated role that comes with specific promotional responsibilities.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How is the Center position different from the Visual in K-POP?</h3>
                <p>While the Visual represents the group's appearance, the Center is the member who stands in the middle during dance formations and key moments in performances. The Center often has strong stage presence and charisma. Sometimes the Visual and Center are the same person, but in many groups these are separate roles held by different members.
